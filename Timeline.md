# Timeline [DRAFT]

This document serves as a general timeline for the 2022 Rust Risk game (hereafter, game). Changes may be submitted by PR. Please keep it to ~1 change/PR. 

## Timeline
- January 1: Decision on whether this will be Aggie Risk Season 4 (hereafter, AR4) or College Football Risk Season 3 (hereafter, CFR3)
- January 14: Moderator beta begins. Teams may open an issue on this GitHub or ping a mod on Discord for login information
- January 21: Moderator beta ends
- February 1: No/Go deadline: After this date, the game must proceed as scheduled in this timeline. Schedule changes thereafter require a 3/4 mod majority or [simple majority user poll](#definitions)
- February 27: Mechanics finalization deadline: After this date, the game mechanics may only be changed with a 3/4 mod majority or [simple majority user poll](#definitions).
- March 7: Open Source Deadline: Internal (negotiable) deadline for open sourcing the administration bot and the API integration bot
- March 13: API stabilization deadline (API endpoints may be added or changed, but should not have spurious changes)
- April 1: First Roll
- May 6: Final Roll (Day 35)

## Rationale
Starting on a Friday allows time for errors to be corrected over the weekend. This falls in line approximately with the timeframe for CFR2. 
Generally, most people seemed to express boredom (and the game stagnated) around day 40 in the past. We therefore will go with a 35-day season. 

## Definitions
- **Simple Majority User Poll**: A poll of all users on the game, wherein each team gets a single yes/no/abstain vote. All votes from a team's users are tallied, and then cast as a team vote: yea (50%user+1), nay (50%user-1), or abstain (50%user). Such changes need only a simple majority of teams to approve the change (50%team+1). Abstentions are discarded as non-votes. The process for triggering a poll shall be agreed to in a separate document.
